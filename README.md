# 🛡️ Guardian

**Guardian** is a beginner-friendly security surveillance system built using **OpenCV**.  
This project is my first hands-on exploration of computer vision — focused on detecting motion and monitoring camera feeds in real time.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn the basics of OpenCV and video processing
- Create a simple, modular surveillance system
- Implement motion detection from a live camera feed
- Lay the foundation for future features like face detection, recording, and alerts

## 🧠 Features

- 🎥 Real-time video feed using webcam or external camera
- 👀 Basic motion detection using frame differencing
- 📦 Modular, readable code — ideal for beginners
- 🚧 (WIP) Foundation for adding face detection, recording, and email/SMS alerts

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)  
- NumPy (for image processing)


pip install opencv-python numpy
